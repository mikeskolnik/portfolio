This repo (WIP) contains a portfolio of non-proprietary testing materials. Its intended audience, and the people I typically share the link for this to, is:
* Context-driven software testers, and those who are interested in effective softwarte testing.
* People involved in the hiring process at companies I apply to work at.

In draft stages:
* How I Build a Test Strategy
